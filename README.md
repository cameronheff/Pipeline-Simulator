# Pipeline-Simulator
C Code that simulates a pipelined processor
simulator takes in a machine code file, and simulates the instructions on a pipelined processor.
Each cycle it prints out the values being held inside registers and pipelines.
An assembler has been included, capable of converting assembly files to machine code for the simulator.
To run the simulator, run: simulator <NAME_OF_MACHINE_CODE_FILE>
Some test files have been included.
